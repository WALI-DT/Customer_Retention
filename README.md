**Project Description: Enhancing Tenant Retention for HomeVibe Properties**

**Overview:**
HomeVibe Properties faced several urgent challenges, including high tenant churn rates, limited insights into tenant satisfaction, inefficient lease renewal processes, and difficulty identifying trends affecting retention. This project, *Customer Retention Dashboard*, addresses these critical business problems by leveraging Power BI to provide actionable insights and data-driven solutions, ensuring operational efficiency and improved tenant retention.

**Objectives:**
1. Develop an interactive tenant retention dashboard to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs).
2. Analyze historical tenant data to uncover factors influencing tenant churn.
3. Streamline lease renewal processes to enhance tenant retention rates.

**Key Features of the Dashboard:**
The project centers around a comprehensive Power BI dashboard (*Customer Retention Dashboard.pbix*), designed to provide a detailed overview of tenant behaviors and retention strategies. The dashboard includes:

1. **Tenant Retention Dashboard:**
   - **KPIs:** Churn rate, average satisfaction score, average rent, occupancy rate, and more.
   - **Visualizations:**
     - Churn rates and satisfaction scores by property type.
     - Renewed vs. unrenewed leases.
     - Frequency of lease terms.
     - Tenant satisfaction scores by property.
   - **Purpose:** To identify trends in tenant behaviors, their causes, and correlations with other factors, providing a holistic view of tenant retention.

2. **Insights and Recommendations:**
   - **Insights:**
     - **Seasonal and Trend-Based Churn Patterns:** Analysis reveals specific periods with higher churn rates, suggesting optimal times for targeted retention efforts.
     - **Lease Term Preferences:** Insights into lease lengths that correlate with higher retention rates guide adjustments to lease offerings.
     - **Satisfaction-Retention Correlation:** Clear evidence shows that higher tenant satisfaction directly reduces churn rates.
     - **Financial Efficiency:** Insights into rent collection performance highlight areas for operational improvement and reinvestment opportunities.
     - **Renewal Strategy Effectiveness:** Data on renewed vs. expired leases provides a measure of the success of retention strategies over time.
   - **Recommendations:**
     - Implement targeted retention programs during high-risk periods, such as personalized communication or special offers.
     - Adjust lease terms to align with tenant preferences, encouraging longer stays.
     - Enhance tenant satisfaction by improving property amenities, maintenance, and community engagement.
     - Optimize rent collection processes to ensure financial stability and tenant satisfaction.
     - Refine renewal strategies with early renewal incentives and transparent communication.
     - Use the dashboard as a living tool for continuous improvement, regularly reviewing data to identify new trends and adjust strategies.

**Deliverables:**
- **Power BI File:** The *Customer Retention Dashboard.pbix* file includes the interactive dashboard for exploring data and insights.
- **Dashboard Snapshots:** A file with static images of the dashboard for quick reference and sharing with stakeholders.

**Impact:**
This project provides HomeVibe Properties with the tools and insights needed to address critical retention challenges and improve tenant satisfaction. By aligning business strategies with data-driven recommendations, HomeVibe can:
- Reduce tenant turnover and associated costs.
- Enhance tenant satisfaction and retention.
